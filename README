Based on assignment for CUDA Assignment for MSc in HPC
Based on calculating an Exponential Integral Calculation
Originally completed 19/05/2017


Note: Requires nvcc for all tests and to be run on GPU
	mpicc/mpirun also required for some tests


To compile:
	make

To run:
	./run
	mpirun ./run

Tests (small grid):
	make test
	make mpitest

Optional Flags:
	-a [float]		- lower interval bound
	-b [float]		- upper interval bound
	-c			- turn off cpu calculation
	-d			- use dynamic parallelism
	-g			- turn off gpu calculation
	-h			- print usage
	-i [int]		- set max iterations
	-j [int]		- set how many n's each slave runs at a time (if multiple cards)
	-m [int]		- set number of samples
	-n [int]		- set number of steps
	-p			- use multiple cards		(MUST use mpirun here)
	-r [int]		- uses streams and sets how many to use
	-s 			- use shared memory
	-t			- print out timing info
	-v			- print out more information
